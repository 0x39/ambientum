# Ambientum example files.

# Template: Laravel - Standard.

# Intended for: Anyone who wants to use Ambientum for a standard Laravel project (including frontending with Laravel Mix).

# NOTES:
# Note 1 - Replace "acme" with your cool project's name. This will avoid conflicting names at
#          any cost.
# Note 1 - This file must be called: "docker-compose.yml"
# Note 2 - Any comments on this file can be stripped out, they have no effect and here for 
#          illustration and documentation purposes.
# Note 3 - You can safely remove any frontend or caching configuration here, they are intended
#          only for speedup the process.
# Note 4 - This example is intended to be a complete reference on a standard install.
#          "laravel-simple.yml" is a great way to start from scratch.
# Note 5 - If you are new to Docker and/or Docker Compose, please try some tutorials
#          on those subjects before jumping into it.

# --> 1 - VERSION: Docker-compose reference syntax version.

# --> 2 - VOLUMES (NAMED): Resources where application and cache data is persisted.

  # MySQL: Stores MySQL data.
  acme-mysql-data:
    driver: local
    
  # Redis: Stores Redis data.
  acme-redis-data:
    
  # The following volumes are used by caching purposes only, while in development.
  # ~/.config
  acme-dot-config:
  # ~/.local  
  acme-dot-local:
  # ~/.cache
  acme-dot-cache:
